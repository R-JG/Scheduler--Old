~ Day Planner Notes ~

_______________
General:

Three main views - calendar, event creation, and selection

Event creation panel where one can add or edit events by clicking and dragging on both the calendar and the hours in the day view.
The event panel also gives a brief list of upcoming events.

The third view displays the current thing that one has selected on the calendar, i.e. a date or an event.

Optional weather overlay according to both calendar and day views


_______________
Events:

Events on the calendar will be independent components, visually as a thin strip over the relevant days, where clicking on them brings the information about the event into view in the selection panel.

Events can be all day or have a specific time frame. In the day view, the precise time frame will be displayed according to hour.

The base form of the event panel will be a create event button, and a list of upcoming events.
In create event mode, the panel will render as a form with inputs for title and description.
It will also have buttons for setting the start and end.
When these buttons are clicked, the calendar and day panel will be set to a mode where clicking on a day or hour defines the start or end dates.


_______________
Day view:

Idea for solving the problem of need for specification of events by minute: click and hold on the hour brings up a minutes window for the hour. Releasing the click selects the minute.
